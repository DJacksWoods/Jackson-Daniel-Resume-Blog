Hey Everyone!

This is the first post of many that will be coming from me. I have recently started to create a website using Jekyll
to act as my online resume as well as a place for me to blog about my recent development practice. 

Using this site i will be keep track of new languages and technology that i am attempting to learn on my own in order to broaden my skillset as
a software developer. I realized that I have been doing a lot of development in my own time, but have not been keeping track of it very well
this ended up being a bad thing when i lost all of my projects when my laptop took a dump on me last year. So, i have decided to keep this updated and hosted
so that if that happens again i won;t lose all my hard work.

I look forward to posting all of my most up to date practice and processes in the near future. Please stay tuned to watch as this site grows from scratch.


Thank You,

Daniel Jackson-Woods
